## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

You play a university student doing **“campus running practice”**, with one clear goal:  
**Find the correct exit door and escape before the enemy catches you.**

1. **Run & Escape:** Always keep moving — time is life.
2. **Path Selection:** At rooms with multiple doors or branches, you must make quick decisions — **only one door leads to the correct escape route**.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Avoid environmental obstacles or fallen objects to maintain smooth running.
4. **Stamina Management:** Continuous sprinting drains stamina.
5. **Bullet Time:** Hold the left mouse button to slow down enemies and escape more safely. Sometimes you can even use this feature to show off.
